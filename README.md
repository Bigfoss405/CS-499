# CS-499
Bachelors of Computer Science: Software Engineering Capstone

## ■ Professional Self-Assessment

My Professional Self-Assessment introduces my development as a computer scientist throughout the Computer Science program and the CS-499 Capstone. It outlines my skills in software design, algorithms and data structures, databases, embedded systems, and full-stack development. It also explains how the capstone enhancements demonstrate my readiness to contribute in a professional software engineering environment.

## ■ Capstone Artifact Narrative

My capstone artifact is EventBuddy, an Android application originally built in CS-360. During CS-499, I enhanced the project to improve its architecture, UI flow, event-handling logic, and database operations. These improvements strengthened the app's maintainability, reliability, and overall design quality.

## ■ Capstone Enhancement Plan

The enhancement plan outlines how EventBuddy was expanded to meet all three CS-499 competency areas:
Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.
It details improvements such as architectural restructuring, new algorithmic logic, improved searching and sorting, schema upgrades, parameterized queries, and better validation.
